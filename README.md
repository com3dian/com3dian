### Hi there 👋

I'm Zehao Lu, currently working as a research engineer at Wageningen University.
My research focuses on applying LLMs to domain-specific applications and building foundation models for science.
I love building apps and tools.

### I’ve built

- An LLM-based [metadata harvester](https://github.com/LTER-LIFE/llm-metadata-harvester).
- A copilot for QGIS, [IntelliGEO](https://github.com/MahdiFarnaghi/intelli_geo).
- Scipy's high dimensional [wasserstein distance](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.wasserstein_distance_nd.html).

### I’m building ✊

- A cross-platform text editor [typrison](https://github.com/com3dian/typistprison).
- A video game (Steam store page coming soon!).

### My relationship with languages 😄
Native to C, happy with Python, eager to learn Julia, vibe-coded in C++, beginner in Rust, broke up with R, ok with Kotlin, & never liked Java.
